# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet once a week, with each meeting lasting 30 minutes. We will host these meetings through Zoom and communicate using iMessage. We will rotate who takes notes each meeting. 
2. **Assistance** 
We all have eachothers iMessage and will respond to eachother within one buisness day. 
3. **Respect** 
We will each take turns responding to eachother and respect eachothers ideas. The beauty of a team is difference of opinions, and we will celebrate eachothers perspectives. 
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Our team will utilize an agile workflow and assign sprints at our weekly meetings. Through communication, we will be able to overcome unexpected complications and if needed work collaborativly. Jai and Bilal will be in charge of making a beautiful front-end and Jessica and Elisa will be in charge of making the back-end. 
5. **Time Commitment** 
Each team member is expected to contribute at least three hours a week to our project. Through communication, we will find times that work for everyone to collaborate and address any conflicts as they come. 
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will refer to the respect section of our contract if disagreements occur. We will work our best to compromise in all situations. If one member is not carrying their weight, we will have a discussion to find how we can be a more effective team. Before we start our project, we discussed every member checking in weekly and alerting the team if they are stuck. In a worst case senario, if a team member doesn't respond to communication after two weeks, we will inform course staff. Since we are all close friends, we believe that we can overcome any obstacle and change the world through the power of friendship.
